### Hi there ✌️

I'm a fullstack developer.

- I've been writing JavaScript for 15+ years (TypeScript for 5+ years)
- I've started playing around with Node in late 2010 (shoutout to [@felixge](https://cre.fm/cre167-nodejs))
- I've spent the last 5+ years building backends with tRPC, gRPC, GraphQL, Fastify, Express and Prisma ...
- ... and Frontends with Next.js, React Native and Nuxt
- I'm obsessed with type-level TypeScript and type systems in general
- I've been building lots of ~~overly~~ complex monorepos, in-house frameworks and libraries
- I've written thousands of lines of GitLab CI YAML and a bunch of GitHub Actions too
- I've written so many Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yamls
- I've built a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster at some point
- I've been living on the command line for 15+ years
