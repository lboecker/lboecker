### Hi there ✌️

I'm a __tech lead and fullstack developer__.

- Writing JavaScript for 15+ years, TypeScript for 5+
- Got into Node.js back in 2010 (thanks [@felixge](https://cre.fm/cre167-nodejs))
- Backend work with AWS, tRPC, gRPC, GraphQL, Fastify, Express, Prisma
- Frontend experience with Next.js, React Native, Nuxt
- Built and maintained large monorepos, internal frameworks, and libraries for teams
- These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about architecture, DX, and how to keep things simple (or at least not _too_ complex)
